# How to run
* don't forget to update the team settings and choose another app identifier if you want to run the app on a real device

* in the folder `Weather/Supporting Files` a plist named `Keys.plist` should be added, the root object should be a dictionary ([String: String] type) and it should contain the key `openWeatherAppId`with the value for your open weather app id.  

# Notes
I could not find `rain chances` anywhere in the today data so this is not displayed in the app.
